# warnings, so I set something else.

# Digipeating paths:
# (read more about digipeating paths here: http://wa8lmf.net/DigiPaths/ )

# The recommended digi path for a balloon is "WIDE2-1" or pathless.
#
# A vehicle or another low ground-based tracker may require help getting to
# a relay, therefore "WIDE1-1,WIDE2-2" might work better. In some places even
# an airborne target (flying in the mountains?) may require more hops to get
# to a gateway.
